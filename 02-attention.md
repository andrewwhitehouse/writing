**Attention**

It's Saturday, and I woke up early. So I thought I would do some writing, which I did by hand. And that worked pretty well. And then the house started to wake up and I found it harder to concentrate. I want to be present for my family _and_ I want (need) to write too. In software delivery we have people, scope and time that we can vary. Applying this to writing, scope can be variable. One side of A4, or a particular concept. Time is a function of the difficulty, and how much preparation is needed. And people is me.

I don't like the term, but you could describe me as a highly sensitive person. I get really easily distracted by noise. And seeing other people being unkind or inconsiderate pisses me off. Working in a consulting role means I need to temper my natural inclination to immediately intervene and possibly damage relationships. So I need to be calm. But in a noisy world I often don't feel calm. And others don't take it well if my bucket is full at the end of the day and they want to talk. Taking the dogs out helps. As long as they don't run off across the field, or poo too much. We have three of them. We had the mum. Decided to keep one of the girls. And then Charyl Baker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO-mxo-14H4 was going to take the boy and then she had a job come up. He's a great dog though. Taking out three of them together is quite hectic.

(Coincidentally the Eurovision is on again tonight. It's a melting pot of geopolitical point scoring. The UK is an outsider in Europe now, and last year we received [nul points](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/what-eurovision-2021-uk-entry-23926857). Who knows if we'll do any better this year. Here is a history of the Russia-Ukraine [through Eurovision](https://qz.com/2164505/the-russia-ukraine-conflict-as-told-through-eurovision-songs/).)

And my wife's been away this week with friends so I've been spinning more plates. 

And one of the recent joiners in our team at work has a way of interacting that didn't work for me: commenting on "being of a certain age", code that makes him "shudder", and in a retro telling our scrum master that she missed an opportunity to call me "pig ignorant". So I had to prepare myself for addressing this behaviour calmly and constructively. And it was really tiring. And I honestly resented having to invest my energy in that, frankly.

I was reminded of Seth's comment that he doesn't manage people because he finds it stressful. And neither does [Dharmesh Shah](https://podnote.io/20210707-dharmesh-shah-mfm.html), Hubspot founder. Hmm ... I see that idea about the community for remote work. Has anyone done that yet?

Steven Pressfield talks about a practice having a place and a time. I struggle to maintain this, based on what else is going on at the time. I find the morning works best for me, before the unpredictable nature of the day frazzles my nerves, and I'm not calm enough to write. Fitting that into the day job can be a challenge. I already have a pomodoro timer, as suggested by Ken. I need to use it more. Even finding half an hour to hand-write something could work. 

Interested to hear what routines work for you.
