**Designing Incentives**

We converted one of the downstairs room to add a bed, which will help to ease pressure when the younger family members are back from university.

An ad hoc gathering this morning of me, three daughters and my partner started off talking about uni exploits and ended up talking about career choices.

Topics covered: how tech companies do a good or not-so-good job of making their companies appealing places for women to work. And how to promote cross-team engagement. It's harder now when more people are remote.

And how managers need to know the law. A company I worked for ended up paying an employee Â£30 to leave after his initial manager didn't perform regular performance assesments and when, his new manager became more proctive he went off sick and claimed he was being discriminated against

And taking time off work to have children could put you at a disadvantage. 

And being in a minority can be harder when you encounter unacceptable behaviour. But there are companies who do it better, so look out for those.

For our daughter studying psychology who is doing an internship in a tech company, I asked her what might interest her in clinicical psychology versus the work experience she's doing.

And we talked about how tech products are designed, and alignment of incentives.

This is more a reminder of themses that I will likely come back to.
