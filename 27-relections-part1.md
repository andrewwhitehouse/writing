**Reflections Part 1 (October 2021)**

I thought it would be helpful to review my posts in WC3 to see what I was focusing on, how those choices were supporting or undermining my goals, and have a look at what might be usable.

I started off by [musing](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070?u=andrewwhitehouse) on Naval Ravikant's almanac (and I reminded of spending time thinking on what it is you should be working on). Ikigai. 

And being comfortable with curating; finding other people's stuff and combining it with my own experience to create something sufficiently new, so it isn't plagiarism. (And I keep coming back to _Steal Like an Artist_.)

I still have this podcast annotation itch that I haven't scratched yet. But I don't know how to make that into a book. Perhaps I could build it and write a book about it. I'm not sure. But there is this other movement of decentralised applications, and aligning incentives so that the business model doesn't have to be advertising with all its optimising for rage and anxiety.

I references my journey dabbling with electriciy early on, and then computers. And the impact of losing my Dad early on, and the box of lights and switches that he made me (and I took apart to see how it worked).

And the person who supported me financially through school, and how there is a strong ethic that we carry with us of remembering the support we have received and in turn helping others.

And maintaining good mental health is important. Because bad things can happen if you don't. And that involves staying open to other people, being _open, generous, and connected_. Often not easy.

Is it necessary to decide up front what is the change you seek to make[?](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/8?u=andrewwhitehouse).

I hypothesized that my audience might be my children, or someone earlier in their career who wants to know how to navigate the tech industry.  I'm providing support in particular to one of my children as she undertakes an internship, and have a project lined up for my son.

My focus now has shifted to _people who want to learn X_ (and I'm still refining what _X_ is).

And Liz Gilbert's words of guidance

1. Tell your story TO someone. Pick one person you love or admire or want to connect with, and write the whole thing directly to them —like you’re writing a letter. This will bring forth your natural voice. Whatever you do, do NOT write to a demographic. Ugh.
2. Start at the beginning of the story, write what happened, and keep going until you get to the end.
3. Use radically simple sentences.
4. Don’t worry if it’s good; just finish it. Whether or not your project is good, you’ll be a different person at the end of it, and that’s always worth doing.
5. Don’t write with the aim of changing anybody’s life. That will lead to heavy, irritating prose. Just share what delights or enrages or fascinates you. If somebody’s life is changed by it, that’s a bonus.
6. Whenever you can, tell stories instead of explaining stuff. Humans love stories, and we hate having stuff explained to us. Use Jesus as an example: He spoke almost exclusively in parables, and allowed everybody to draw their own lessons from his great storytelling. And he did very well.
7. Your work doesn’t have to be any particular length, or written for any particular market. It doesn’t have to even be seen by another human being. How and if to publish your work is a problem for another day. For today, just write.
8. Remember that you’ve been doing research your whole life, merely by existing. You are the only expert in your own experience. Embrace this as your supreme qualification.
9. Every writer starts in the same place on Day One: Super excited, and ready for greatness. On Day Two, every writer looks at what she wrote on Day One and hates herself. What separates working writers from non-working writers is that working writers return to their task on Day Three. What gets you there is not pride but mercy. Show yourself forgiveness, for not being good enough. Then keep going
10. Be willing to let it be easy. You might be surprised. ❤️ LG

And whatever I do, it helps for it to be [sustainable, relevant and differentiated](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/11?u=andrewwhitehouse).

(I also have an idea for organising my MP3s that are stored in Dropbox into a sensible playlist, but I keep coming up with reasons not to do it, mainly "no-one will pay for it".)

I started to get some sense of what the writing might look like when I considered accessibility. I find reading hard work. I suspect I have some form of ADHD. So if I'm learning something new, what I want is something that tells me "do this" and then gives just enough explanation after. I get really frustrated with books that waffle on taking up my brain capacity, probably because they want to increase their page count.

And I like small paragraphs with whitespace between them because I find it easier to track the paragraphs then.

And during WC3 I've attended a few different interviews that for differeing reasons haven't resulted in an offer. But it's helped me gauge what people are looking for. And I wonder if I'm trying too much to fit into what other people say I should do for a career (Seth wrote a post called "fitting in, but not too much" somewhere, which resonates on this point.)

And I think I do better creative work in the morning. If it's bashing out code it's more deterministic and so the "next step" is well defined.

And this, from Naval Ravikant:

> Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is 'hot right now'. If your curiosity ever leads you to a place where society eventually wants to go, you'll get paid extremely well.
> 
> You're more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don't have to pay you. You want to know how to do something other people don't know how to do at the time period when those skills are in demaind.
> 
> You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn't know how to get elsewhere. A lot of people think you can go to school and study for how to make money, but the reality is, there's no skill called "business".
> 
> Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. This is really the challenge of how to make money.
>
> What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you're tracked on the outputs. 

I did an [exericse](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/19?u=andrewwhitehouse) on my values, which I identified as "freedom, family and connection". Marc Benioff asks what's your highest value, the thing that you won't compromise on? I think Marc Benioff is someone whose way of being I can relate to.

The Stay at Home Choir actually [released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VEkry3JLek) Home this week. The [submission](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/25?u=andrewwhitehouse) was back in October. I'm in there somewhere, but it feels like an advanced-level Where's Wally.

I found some useful [advice](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/252231) on building a business which I haven't followed yet. And maybe mentors [aren't that important](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/33?u=andrewwhitehouse).

I [mused](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/39?u=andrewwhitehouse) on the importance of timing, how Gates, Jobs, Zuckerberg and others were all at a particular point in their careers to take advantage of technology inflexion points (the PC, the mobile phone).

Still in October 2021, I covered some of my journey working in payment systems where the Cloud wasn't even a glint in Jeff Bezos's eye. But now it's a thing and making Amazon and co very wealthy thank you very much. 

And blockchain. That's one of the current inflexion points because the banks have proven 

>Education, distraction, coding and problems worth solving: related to the above, I see lots of coding bootcamps that are teaching the skills that are useful to get hired. How can we do better? Make it easier for people with diverse background, and ways of interacting, to get into technology so that we build products that meet the needs of a wider audience. And traditional schooling is still geared towards passing through the gates the lead to an expensive university education. Especially state-funded education. That model is obviously broken. And our attention is greatly in demand from those whose business models want us to see ads. So we're more distracted. Which makes it harder to sustain the continuous learning that we need to adapt. What are the foundational skills that we need, especially as technology use is increasing in some historically highly paid professionals (like [law](https://www.ft.com/content/66853b7c-b62a-461e-9d85-bb805e8dff97)). As Mike Maples put it [in my partially finished [podcast notes](https://idealog.co/20210621-mike-maples-mfm.html)]:

>>If the twentieth century was about being the 'organisation' man, and following the rules and progressing up the hierarchy (it doesn't exist any more), now you have to take agency for your own life and own your comparative advantage and understand that is your responsibility as a free person in this world.

[ADHD can be a gift](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/47?u=andrewwhitehouse).

At the end of October when the clocks go back, we took part in the [CALM walk](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/andrew-whitehouse13) again. It's a reminder of the significance of mental health to our family.

I spent some of the early posts looking at "serverless" as a model for building applications. It's useful as a way of saving money, but I'm not sure it needs to be the primary focus. As I've been looking at Golang recently, I see that another model is picking something that runs very quickly and sticking it on a server.

I spent more time thinking about [who this project is for](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/andrew-whitehouse-dailies/61070/55?u=andrewwhitehouse). It could be for those who find working in tech more difficult because they have cognitive challenges, or those who want an alternative to universities, or those who don't want to fit in too much in a corporate role.

Some guidance from Louise:

>this is a book writing course
>
>choose to write a book
>
>choose now
>
>write what you wish existed
>
>it will resonate with people like you
>
>make it small
>
>make it manageable
>
>sounds like you have five books in you
>
>start with the easiest one so you get your training wheels
>

I came up with a "who is it for" list for the kindling. These are the ones that still resonate.

>* My children [_I've relaxed on this one and will keep suggesting things but be led by them_]
>* My 22 year old self; a.k.a. things I wish I’d know when I started out
>* People working on tech who are looking for a change of direction
>* Developers who aren’t sure how to do product validation
>* Software developers who want to make sense of blockchain
